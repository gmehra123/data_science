**About me-** I am a Data and Analytics professional looking to solve business problems using statistics, Machine Learning and data centric approaches with 6+ years of pricing and strategic intiatives experience. This page is a set of the blog articles I have written as case studies which address common business problems such as forecasting time series, simulating uncertainity with various scenarios and using clustering approaches to segmentation.
